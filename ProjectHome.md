Connects to Canto's Cumulus Server using the Java API and devlivers high-quality low-res images and XHTML pages for static publishing of large image collections. The export also generates XML and Google sitemaps for indexing.

Everything can be customized: from which fields are shown (defined by a record viewset) to visible watermarking. The program is optimized for handling very large collections (250'000 images should be no problem) and very large source formats (a 60MB TIFF source image is perfect). RGB, CMYK and grayscale support (8-bit, 16-bit, partly works also with non-standard colorspace JPG images). Only images that have been changed in the Cumulus systems are updated (update mechanism). Page templates can be customized using XSL.

This program is used in product at ETH-Bibliothek, Zurich where the image archive is published in low-resolution under a Creative Commons CC BY-NC-ND license: example image: http://www.e-pics.ethz.ch/index/ETHBIB.Bildarchiv/ETHBIB.Bildarchiv_Dia_247-00198_30030.html. More information at: http://www.e-pics.ethz.ch and http://www.library.ethz.ch. The export of the archive is also used within the ETH knowledge portal.
